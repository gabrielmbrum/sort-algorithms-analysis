# sort algorithms analysis
this repo contains the main sort algorithms implemented in C.
beyond that, it has a algorithm complexity analysis (w/ some graphs to help the visualization).
it was a activity of Analysis and Algorithm Project =)

## which algorithms were implemented?
<ul>
  <li>bubblesort</li>
  <li>insertionsort</li>
  <li>quicksort</li>
  <li>heapsort</li>
</ul>
  
## graphs

## conclusions
