# sorting algorithm analysis
this repo contains the main sort algorithms implemented in C.
beyond that, it has a algorithm complexity analysis (w/ some graphs to help the vizualisation).
it was a activity of Analysis and Algorithm Project =)

## which algorithms were implemented?

## graphs

## conclusions
